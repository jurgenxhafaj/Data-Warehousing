# Data-Warehousing
This repository includes the final project of my Data Warehousing class.
For a preview of the database's functionality and contents, see the presentation file.

The goal of this class was to organize data from different sources, connect them with relationships, construct a useful ERD, and finally incorporating all of the information into a SQL database.
The program used for data warehousing was Oracle SQL Developer 2008.

The class was led by Dr. Tom Carlile, Tarleton State University.
